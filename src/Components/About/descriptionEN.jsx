        Hello, my name is Kamal Al-Hakim Khalak and I am a dentist. I graduated
        from the University of the Basque Country, Leioa, where I obtained my
        Bachelor's degree in Dentistry after completing my studies at Colegio
        Federico Baraibar in Vitoria-Gasteiz. During my academic training, I
        acquired a solid foundation of knowledge in dentistry and developed key
        skills for the field.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my years of study, I had the opportunity to participate in
        voluntary practices at Dra. López de Luzuriaga Orthodontic Clinic.
        There, I gained practical experience and expanded my knowledge in
        orthodontic treatments. I actively participated in the development of
        treatment plans and familiarized myself with the Invisalign® system,
        allowing me to understand the latest techniques and technologies in the
        field of orthodontics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I acquired computer skills in programs like Excel and
        Word, enabling me to efficiently and accurately handle documentation and
        data analysis. I value teamwork and professionalism, and I am always
        motivated to learn and improve my skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to my dental training, I obtained my Bachelor's degree at Colegio
        Federico Baraibar in Vitoria-Gasteiz. During that time, I also
        volunteered in dental clinics such as Aladium and CS 3D Imaging, which
        provided me with experience in assisting dental operative and endodontic
        treatments, as well as using rotary systems in endodontics.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my academic training, I have participated in courses and
        conferences to stay updated on the latest advances in dentistry. I
        attended the course "Think Digital, Discover the Latest Digital Workflow
        in Dentistry" and the Dental Conferences at UPV/EHU. I have also
        obtained certification as a Director of X-ray Facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have language skills in Spanish, my native language, as well as
        advanced proficiency in English (C1) and intermediate proficiency in
        German (B2). Furthermore, I am available immediately and capable of
        working in a fast-paced and high-pressure environment.
